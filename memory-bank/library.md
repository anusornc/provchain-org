# Library Context7 IDs

This file tracks Context7-compatible Library IDs that have been searched for and resolved, as specified in .clinerules/rules.md. Before searching for new libraries, check this file first to use existing Library IDs.

## Format
Each entry includes:
- **Library Name**: The name searched for
- **Context7 ID**: The resolved Library ID in format `/org/project` or `/org/project/version`
- **Description**: Brief description of the library
- **Date Added**: When this ID was resolved
- **Use Cases**: How this library relates to ProvChainOrg

## Usage Instructions

1. **Before Searching**: Always check this file first for existing Library IDs
2. **When Adding**: Include all required fields (Library Name, Context7 ID, Description, Date Added, Use Cases)
3. **Format**: Use the established format for consistency
4. **Categories**: Add new categories as needed for different types of libraries
5. **Updates**: Update existing entries if better or more specific Library IDs are found

## Example Entry Format
