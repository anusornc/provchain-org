# ProvChainOrg Project Brief

## Project Identity
**Name:** ProvChainOrg  
**Type:** Distributed Blockchain System for Supply Chain Traceability  
**Implementation:** Production-ready Rust implementation of GraphChain research  
**Domain:** Semantic Blockchain with RDF-native data storage  

## Core Mission
Implement a **permissioned blockchain for traceability** that combines blockchain security with semantic web technologies, enabling comprehensive supply chain tracking through RDF graphs and SPARQL queries with formal ontology support.

## Research Foundation
Based on "GraphChain â€“ A Distributed Database with Explicit Semantics and Chained RDF Graphs" by Sopek et al. (2018), this project bridges academic research with practical implementation for real-world supply chain traceability applications.

## Key Innovation Areas

### 1. RDF-Native Blockchain Architecture
- Blocks reference RDF graphs directly (not embedded data)
- Named graphs stored in Oxigraph triplestore
- Cryptographic linking with RDF canonicalization
- Semantic data access through SPARQL queries

### 2. Domain-Flexible Ontology Integration
- Deployment-time ontology configuration for different domains
- Pre-configured ontologies: supply chain, healthcare, pharmaceutical, automotive, digital assets
- Automatic loading and validation using PROV-O extended ontologies
- Data consistency through known and validated ontologies

### 3. Advanced RDF Canonicalization
- Deterministic hashing of RDF graphs with blank node handling
- Magic_S and Magic_O placeholder system for canonicalization
- Semantic equivalence detection for blockchain integrity
- Hybrid approach using both custom and W3C RDFC-1.0 algorithms

### 4. Comprehensive Transaction System
- Digital signatures with Ed25519 cryptography
- Multi-participant wallet system with role-based permissions
- Transaction types: Production, Processing, Transport, Quality, Transfer, Environmental, Compliance, Governance
- Business logic validation for different transaction types

## Target Use Cases

### Primary: Supply Chain Traceability
- Track products from origin to consumer with complete provenance
- Environmental monitoring with temperature/humidity data
- Quality control and compliance tracking
- Multi-participant ecosystem with farmers, manufacturers, logistics, retailers

### Secondary: Multi-Domain Applications
- Healthcare: Patient data and medical device traceability
- Pharmaceutical: Drug manufacturing and distribution tracking
- Automotive: Parts and assembly line traceability
- Digital Assets: Ownership and provenance tracking

## Technical Requirements

### Core Capabilities
- **Blockchain Security**: Cryptographic integrity with hash-linked blocks
- **Semantic Accessibility**: Full SPARQL query support across all data
- **Ontology Validation**: Automatic class-based validation and property enforcement
- **Distributed Architecture**: P2P networking with peer discovery and synchronization
- **Performance**: Production-ready with caching, compression, and optimization
- **Persistence**: RocksDB backend with backup/restore functionality

### Integration Requirements
- **Web API**: REST endpoints for blockchain interaction and SPARQL queries
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive configuration management for deployment flexibility
- **Monitoring**: Metrics collection and health monitoring for production deployment

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Core Implementation âœ… COMPLETE
- RDF-native blockchain with canonicalization
- Ontology integration and validation
- Transaction system with digital signatures
- Comprehensive test suite (27 tests passing)
- CLI interface and demo applications

### Phase 2: Distributed Network ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- Full P2P networking implementation
- Consensus mechanism (Proof-of-Authority)
- Cross-node synchronization
- Federated SPARQL queries

### Phase 3: Production Deployment ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- Performance optimization and scalability testing
- Production monitoring and compliance features
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Real-world deployment scenarios

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Permissioned Network**: Designed for known participants, not public blockchain
- **Ontology Consistency**: Deployment-time configuration to ensure data consistency
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Semantic richness vs. transaction throughput
- **Storage Requirements**: RDF data requires more storage than simple key-value

### Business Constraints
- **Domain Expertise**: Requires understanding of both blockchain and semantic web technologies
- **Participant Onboarding**: Need for participant training and certification management
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Must support various industry-specific compliance requirements

## Strategic Vision
Create the definitive implementation of semantic blockchain technology that demonstrates how RDF graphs and ontologies can enhance blockchain applications beyond simple cryptocurrency, establishing a new paradigm for traceable, queryable, and semantically rich distributed ledgers.

## Current Status
**Production-ready core implementation** with comprehensive blockchain functionality, RDF storage, ontology integration, and transaction processing. Ready for distributed networking implementation and real-world deployment scenarios.
