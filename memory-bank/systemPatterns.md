# System Patterns - Architecture and Technical Decisions

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. RDF-Native Blockchain Pattern
**Pattern**: Store RDF graphs directly in blockchain blocks rather than embedding RDF as payload data.

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct Block {
    pub index: u64,           // Sequential block number
    pub timestamp: String,    // ISO 8601 timestamp
    pub data: String,         // RDF data in Turtle format
    pub previous_hash: String, // Link to previous block
    pub hash: String,         // Canonicalized RDF hash
    pub state_root: String,   // State root hash for atomic consistency
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Each block's RDF data stored in named graph: `http://provchain.org/block/{index}`
- Block metadata itself stored as RDF in dedicated graph: `http://provchain.org/blockchain`
- Cryptographic hash includes canonicalized RDF content for semantic integrity
- SPARQL queries can span entire blockchain history

**Benefits**:
- Native semantic querying across all blockchain data
- Semantic equivalence detection through canonicalization
- Rich relationship modeling within blockchain structure
- Standards-compliant RDF storage and access

    Comprehensive,  // ~100-500ms - Full validation with caching
    Full,          // ~1-5s - Complete validation with all checks
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
