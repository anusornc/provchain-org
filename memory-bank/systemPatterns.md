# System Patterns - Architecture and Technical Decisions

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. RDF-Native Blockchain Pattern
**Pattern**: Store RDF graphs directly in blockchain blocks rather than embedding RDF as payload data.

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct Block {
    pub index: u64,           // Sequential block number
    pub timestamp: String,    // ISO 8601 timestamp
    pub data: String,         // RDF data in Turtle format
    pub previous_hash: String, // Link to previous block
    pub hash: String,         // Canonicalized RDF hash
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Each block's RDF data stored in named graph: `http://provchain.org/block/{index}`
- Block metadata itself stored as RDF in dedicated graph: `http://provchain.org/blockchain`
- Cryptographic hash includes canonicalized RDF content for semantic integrity
- SPARQL queries can span entire blockchain history

**Benefits**:
- Native semantic querying across all blockchain data
- Semantic equivalence detection through canonicalization
- Rich relationship modeling within blockchain structure
- Standards-compliant RDF storage and access

### 2. Hybrid RDF Canonicalization Pattern
**Pattern**: Adaptive canonicalization algorithm selection based on graph complexity.

**Implementation**:
- **Custom Algorithm**: Magic_S/Magic_O placeholder system for blank nodes
- **W3C RDFC-1.0**: Standards-compliant canonicalization for complex graphs
- **Adaptive Selection**: Choose algorithm based on graph analysis

**Key Decisions**:
- Deterministic blank node handling for consistent hashing
- Semantic equivalence detection across different RDF serializations
- Performance optimization through algorithm selection
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

**Benefits**:
- Consistent block hashing regardless of RDF serialization format
- Semantic integrity validation

- Standards compliance with W3C recommendations

### 3. Domain-Flexible Ontology Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: Deployment-time ontology configuration for different traceability domains.

**Implementation**:
```toml
[main_ontology]
path = "ontologies/generic_core.owl"
graph_iri = "http://provchain.org/ontology/core"
auto_load = true
validate_data = false

[domain_ontologies.supply_chain]
path = "ontologies/supply-chain.owl"
graph_iri = "http://provchain.org/ontology/supply-chain"
enabled = true
priority = 100
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Single ontology configuration at deployment time
- PROV-O foundation with domain-specific extensions

- Extensible to new domains without code changes

### 4. Multi-Participant Transaction Pattern
**Pattern**: Role-based transaction system with digital signatures and business logic validation.

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub enum TransactionType {
    Production,    // Raw material production
    Processing,    // Manufacturing processes
    Transport,     // Logistics activities
    Quality,       // Quality control
    Transfer,      // Ownership transfers
    Environmental, // Environmental monitoring
    Compliance,    // Regulatory compliance
    Governance,    // System governance
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Ed25519 digital signatures for cryptographic security

### 2. Semantic Metadata Pattern
**Pattern**: Store blockchain metadata as RDF triples for semantic consistency.

**Implementation**:
```turtle
@prefix bc: <http://provchain.org/blockchain#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

bc:block_1 a bc:Block ;
    bc:hasIndex "1"^^xsd:integer ;
    bc:hasTimestamp "2025-08-26T14:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    bc:hasPreviousHash "abc123..." ;
    bc:hasHash "def456..." ;
    bc:containsGraph <http://provchain.org/block/1> .
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent semantic representation

- `prov:Agent` - Participants, organizations, systems

**Key Relationships**:
- `prov:wasGeneratedBy` - Entity creation
- `prov:used` - Activity inputs
