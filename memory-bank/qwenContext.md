# Qwen Context - AI Model Integration

This file integrates the QWEN.md content into the memory bank system, providing context specifically for AI model interactions with the ProvChainOrg project.

## Project Summary for AI Models

### Core Identity
ProvChainOrg is a **comprehensive Rust implementation** of a blockchain where each block stores RDF triples in named graphs using Oxigraph. The system is designed as a **permissioned blockchain for traceability** that supports multiple domains through **domain-flexible ontology integration**.

### Key Architectural Principles

#### RDF-Native Blockchain Design
- Each block stores RDF data in named graphs (`http://provchain.org/block/{index}`)
- Blockchain metadata itself stored as RDF in dedicated graph (`http://provchain.org/blockchain`)
- Full SPARQL query support across all blockchain data
- Advanced RDF canonicalization (RDFC-1.0) for consistent hashing

#### Domain-Flexible Ontology System
- **Deployment-time configuration**: Users configure ontology at deployment for consistency
- **Multiple domain support**: Supply chain, healthcare, pharmaceutical, automotive, digital assets
- **PROV-O foundation**: W3C provenance ontology extended for traceability
- **Automatic validation**: Class-based validation and property enforcement

#### Production-Ready Architecture
- **Comprehensive testing**: 27 tests across 8 test suites
- **Performance optimized**: Caching, compression, and optimization features
- **Enterprise integration**: REST API, authentication, monitoring
- **Modular design**: Clear separation of concerns across components

## Technology Stack Context
