# Task: Make Tests Pass When Removing Ontology File and Using core.owl

## Todo List

- [ ] Enhance core.owl with OWL2 features (hasKey, property chains, qualified cardinality)
- [ ] Update test files to use core.owl instead of advanced_owl2_reasoning.owl
- [ ] Update IRI references in test files
- [ ] Update test assertions to match new ontology structure
- [ ] Run tests to verify implementation
