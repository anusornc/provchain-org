## Paper 1: Adaptive RDF Canonicalization

### Title Options
1. "Adaptive RDF Canonicalization for Blockchain Traceability: Balancing Performance and Standards Compliance"
2. "Performance-Optimized RDF Canonicalization in Supply Chain Blockchain: A Hybrid Approach"
3. "Domain-Specific RDF Canonicalization: Optimizing Blockchain Traceability for Supply Chain Applications"

### Abstract Framework
```
Background: RDF canonicalization is critical for blockchain-based traceability systems, 
but existing standards like URDNA2015/RDFC-1.0 prioritize correctness over performance, 
creating bottlenecks in real-time supply chain applications.

Problem: Supply chain traceability requires sub-second response times for product 
verification, but standard canonicalization algorithms can take seconds or minutes 
for complex graphs, making them impractical for production deployment.

Solution: We propose an adaptive RDF canonicalization approach that automatically 
selects between a high-performance custom algorithm for simple graphs and the 
standard RDFC-1.0 algorithm for complex cases, ensuring both performance and correctness.

Results: Experimental evaluation shows 5-40x performance improvement for typical 
supply chain graphs while maintaining 100% correctness through intelligent fallback 
to standard algorithms for complex cases.

Impact: This approach enables practical deployment of RDF-based blockchain traceability 
systems in production environments while maintaining standards compliance and 
mathematical correctness guarantees.
