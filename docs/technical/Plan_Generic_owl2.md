# Plan: Generic Traceability with OWL2 Enhancements

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a generic traceability system with advanced OWL2 feature support for the ProvChainOrg platform. The approach focuses on creating a decoupled, configuration-driven architecture that can support any traceability domain while leveraging advanced OWL2 reasoning capabilities.
