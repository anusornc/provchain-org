## OWL2 Features Implemented (Placeholder Stage)

### Core OWL2 Features
1. **owl:hasKey Support** - Placeholder implemented
2. **Property Chain Axiom Processing** - Placeholder implemented
3. **Qualified Cardinality Restrictions** - Placeholder implemented

### Integration Points
1. **horned-owl Integration** - Enhanced with proper error handling
2. **oxigraph Integration** - Ready for inferred relationship storage
3. **Configuration System** - Flexible configuration-driven approach

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Implement Actual OWL2 Features
1. **Complete owl:hasKey Implementation**
   - Parse owl:hasKey axioms from ontologies
   - Implement uniqueness constraint validation
   - Add comprehensive test coverage

2. **Complete Property Chain Implementation**
   - Parse owl:propertyChainAxiom from ontologies
   - Implement transitive relationship inference
   - Add performance optimization for chain processing

3. **Complete Qualified Cardinality Implementation**
   - Parse qualified cardinality restrictions
   - Implement validation logic
   - Add test cases for various scenarios

### Phase 2: Integration and Testing
1. **Integrate with oxigraph for inferred relationships**
   - Store inferred axioms in oxigraph for efficient querying
   - Enable SPARQL queries on inferred relationships
   - Implement caching for frequently used inferences

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize property chain inference algorithms
   - Improve uniqueness constraint checking
   - Implement caching strategies for complex reasoning

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all OWL2 features
   - Integration tests with supply chain data
   - Performance benchmarking with complex ontologies

### Phase 3: Generic Traceability Implementation
1. **Ontology Restructuring**
   - Refactor core.owl to contain only generic concepts
   - Create domain extension pattern using OWL2 import mechanisms
   - Implement plugin-based domain management system

2. **Configuration System**
   - Create YAML-based configuration files
   - Implement CLI for ontology loading
   - Add domain switching capabilities

3. **Cross-Domain Capabilities**
   - Implement cross-domain OWL2 reasoning
   - Add cross-domain query support
   - Create domain bridging mechanisms
