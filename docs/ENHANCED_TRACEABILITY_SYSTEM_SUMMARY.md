# Enhanced Supply Chain Traceability System Summary

## Executive Summary

This document presents the implementation and evaluation of an enhanced supply chain traceability system for the ProvChainOrg blockchain platform. The system applies concepts from Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithms to optimize RDF graph traversal for supply chain traceability queries, resulting in significant performance improvements while maintaining mathematical rigor.

## System Overview

The enhanced traceability system implements two key optimization techniques inspired by SSSP algorithms:
