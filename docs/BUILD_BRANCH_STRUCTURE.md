# ProvChainOrg Git Branch Structure

## Overview
This document describes the git branch structure for the ProvChainOrg project, specifically for implementing OWL2 features and generic traceability capabilities.

## Branch Hierarchy

```
main (stable production branch)
├── feature/owl2-enhancements (OWL2 feature implementation)
├── feature/generic-traceability (Generic traceability implementation)
└── feature/unified-owl2-generic (Integrated OWL2 + generic traceability)
```

## Branch Descriptions

### `main`
- **Purpose**: Stable production branch
- **Content**: Production-ready code with all features integrated and tested
- **Workflow**: Only accept merges from feature branches after thorough testing

### `feature/owl2-enhancements`
- **Purpose**: Implement advanced OWL2 reasoning features
- **Key Features**:
  - `owl:hasKey` axiom support for uniqueness constraints
  - `owl:propertyChainAxiom` for transitive relationships
  - Qualified cardinality restrictions for precise validation
  - Integration with horned-owl and oxigraph
- **Owner**: [To be assigned]
- **Status**: Ready for development

### `feature/generic-traceability`
- **Purpose**: Create domain-agnostic traceability foundation
- **Key Features**:
  - Generic core ontology with abstract traceability concepts
  - Domain extension pattern using OWL2 import mechanisms
  - Plugin-based domain management system
  - Configuration-driven ontology loading
- **Owner**: [To be assigned]
- **Status**: Ready for development

### `feature/unified-owl2-generic`
- **Purpose**: Integrate OWL2 features with generic traceability
- **Key Features**:
  - Cross-domain OWL2 reasoning capabilities
  - Unified configuration system
  - Performance optimization for complex ontologies
  - Comprehensive integration testing
- **Owner**: [To be assigned]
- **Status**: Ready for integration work

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Developers work on individual feature branches
2. Regular commits with descriptive messages
3. Unit tests for all new functionality
4. Periodic pushes to remote for backup

### Integration Process
1. Feature-complete branches merged to `feature/unified-owl2-generic`
2. Integration testing and conflict resolution
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Documentation updates

### Release Process
1. Thorough testing of unified branch
2. Merge to `main` after approval
3. Tag release version
4. Deploy to production

## Branch Management Commands

### Creating Feature Branches
```bash
# Create OWL2 enhancements branch
git checkout -b feature/owl2-enhancements main

# Create generic traceability branch
git checkout -b feature/generic-traceability main

# Create unified branch
git checkout -b feature/unified-owl2-generic main
```

### Switching Between Branches
```bash
# Switch to OWL2 branch
git checkout feature/owl2-enhancements

# Switch to generic traceability branch
git checkout feature/generic-traceability

# Switch to unified branch
git checkout feature/unified-owl2-generic

# Switch to main
git checkout main
```

### Merging Progress
```bash
# Merge OWL2 progress to unified branch
git checkout feature/unified-owl2-generic
git merge feature/owl2-enhancements

# Merge generic traceability progress to unified branch
git checkout feature/unified-owl2-generic
git merge feature/generic-traceability
```

## Success Criteria

### Branch Creation
- [x] All four branches created successfully
- [x] Clear separation of concerns between branches
- [x] Remote tracking established
- [x] Initial commits documenting branch purposes

### Development Readiness
- [x] Clean working directories for all branches
- [x] No conflicting changes between branches
- [x] Documentation of branch purposes
- [x] Ready for parallel development

## Next Steps

1. Assign ownership of feature branches to developers
2. Begin parallel implementation in feature branches
3. Establish regular integration schedule
4. Set up continuous integration for all branches
5. Create milestone tracking for feature completion

This branch structure enables organized, parallel development while maintaining the ability to integrate features progressively and safely.
