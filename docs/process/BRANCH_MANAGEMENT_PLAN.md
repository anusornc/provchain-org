# Branch Management and Implementation Plan

## Current Status Confirmation

Before proceeding with branch management, please confirm the current state of your repository by running these commands:

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Check current status
git status

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -3
```

## Git Branch Management Plan

### Phase 1: Current Branch Preservation

#### Task 1.1: Commit Any Outstanding Changes
```bash
# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status

# If there are changes to commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Preserve current work before branching
- Documentation enhancements completed
- Performance optimizations verified (1.20s test completion)
- OWL reasoner configuration updated
- All tests passing"
```

#### Task 1.2: Update Main Branch
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# If your current work should be on main:
# git merge your-current-branch-name
# git push origin main
```

### Phase 2: Create Feature Branches

#### Task 2.1: Create OWL2 Enhancements Branch
```bash
# Create new branch for OWL2 features from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/owl2-enhancements

# Verify branch creation
git branch

# Initial commit to establish branch
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialize OWL2 enhancements branch
- Branch created for implementing advanced OWL2 features
- Will include: owl:hasKey, property chains, qualified cardinality"
```

#### Task 2.2: Create Generic Traceability Branch
```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Create new branch for generic traceability from main
git checkout -b feature/generic-traceability

# Verify branch creation
git branch

# Initial commit to establish branch
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialize generic traceability branch
- Branch created for implementing domain-agnostic traceability
- Will include: generic core ontology, domain plugins, configuration-driven loading"
```

#### Task 2.3: Create Unified Feature Branch
```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Create unified branch that will contain both features
git checkout -b feature/unified-owl2-generic

# Verify branch creation
git branch

# Initial commit to establish branch
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialize unified OWL2 + Generic Traceability branch
- Branch created for integrated implementation
- Will merge both OWL2 enhancements and generic traceability features"
```

### Phase 3: Branch Structure Verification

#### Task 3.1: Verify All Branches Exist
```bash
# List all branches to verify creation
git branch -a

# Expected output should show:
# * feature/unified-owl2-generic
#   feature/owl2-enhancements  
#   feature/generic-traceability
#   main
#   remotes/origin/main (if remote exists)
```

#### Task 3.2: Document Branch Purposes
```bash
# Create a simple documentation of branch purposes
echo "# ProvChainOrg Branch Structure

## Main Branches
- **main**: Stable production branch

## Feature Branches
- **feature/owl2-enhancements**: Advanced OWL2 feature implementation
- **feature/generic-traceability**: Generic domain-agnostic traceability
- **feature/unified-owl2-generic**: Integrated implementation of both features

## Branch Hierarchy

├── feature/generic-traceability
└── feature/unified-owl2-generic

```

## Implementation Branch Assignment

### Branch: `feature/owl2-enhancements`
**Purpose**: Implement advanced OWL2 reasoning features
**Owner**: [Your Name]
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-4

1. Enhance horned-owl integration for OWL2 features
2. Implement `owl:hasKey` axiom support
3. Add `owl:propertyChainAxiom` processing
4. Implement qualified cardinality restrictions
5. Integrate with oxigraph for inferred relationship storage
6. Add comprehensive tests for all OWL2 features

### Branch: `feature/generic-traceability`
**Purpose**: Create domain-agnostic traceability foundation
**Owner**: [Your Name]
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-4

**Key Implementation Tasks**:
1. Refactor core.owl to generic concepts
2. Implement domain extension pattern
3. Create plugin-based domain management
4. Implement configuration-driven ontology loading
5. Update blockchain for generic entities
6. Add domain switching capabilities

### Branch: `feature/unified-owl2-generic`
**Purpose**: Integrate both features and create production-ready implementation
**Owner**: [Your Name]
**Timeline**: Weeks 5-8

**Key Integration Tasks**:
1. Merge feature branches (resolve conflicts)
2. Implement cross-domain OWL2 reasoning
3. Add comprehensive integration tests
4. Performance optimization
5. Documentation updates
6. Final validation and testing

## Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow for Each Branch
```bash
# Switch to appropriate branch
git checkout feature/owl2-enhancements  # or other branch

# Pull latest changes (if collaborative)
git pull origin feature/owl2-enhancements

# Make changes and commit incrementally
git add src/semantic/owl_reasoner.rs
git commit -m "feat(owl2): Implement owl:hasKey axiom parsing
- Add support for parsing owl:hasKey axioms from ontologies
- Create internal representation for uniqueness constraints
- Add basic validation framework"

# Push changes to remote for backup
git push origin feature/owl2-enhancements
```

### Weekly Integration Process
```bash
# At end of week, merge progress to unified branch
git checkout feature/unified-owl2-generic

# Merge progress from feature branches
git merge feature/owl2-enhancements
git merge feature/generic-traceability

# Resolve any conflicts
# git add conflicted-files
# git commit

# Push unified branch
git push origin feature/unified-owl2-generic
```

## Branch Protection and Safety Measures

### Task 4.1: Protect Main Branch
Ensure main branch cannot be accidentally modified:
```bash
# Only allow fast-forward merges to main
# Use pull requests for merging features to main
# Set up branch protection rules in GitHub/GitLab if using remote
```

### Task 4.2: Regular Backups
```bash
# Tag important milestones in each branch
git tag -a owl2-milestone-1 -m "First implementation of OWL2 features"
git push origin owl2-milestone-1

# Tag unified integration milestones
git tag -a unified-milestone-1 -m "Integrated OWL2 and generic traceability"
git push origin unified-milestone-1
```

## Success Criteria for Branch Management

### Branch Creation Success
- [ ] All four branches exist (`main`, `feature/owl2-enhancements`, `feature/generic-traceability`, `feature/unified-owl2-generic`)
- [ ] Each branch has clear purpose and initial commit
- [ ] Branch structure documented
- [ ] Remote tracking established (if using remote repository)

### Implementation Success
- [ ] `feature/owl2-enhancements`: All OWL2 features implemented and tested
- [ ] `feature/generic-traceability`: Generic traceability system operational
- [ ] `feature/unified-owl2-generic`: Both features integrated successfully
- [ ] All branches contain working, testable code at all times

### Collaboration Success
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns between branches
- [ ] Regular integration and conflict resolution
- [ ] Comprehensive commit messages
- [ ] Proper tagging of milestones

## Next Steps After Branch Creation

Once branches are established, proceed with:

1. **Week 1**: Parallel implementation in feature branches
   - OWL2: horned-owl enhancements
   - Generic: Core ontology refactoring

2. **Week 2**: Continued feature development
   - OWL2: Reasoner implementation
   - Generic: Domain plugin architecture

3. **Week 3**: Advanced feature implementation
   - OWL2: Integration with oxigraph
   - Generic: Configuration system

4. **Week 4**: Testing and refinement
   - OWL2: Unit testing and validation
   - Generic: Domain switching tests

5. **Week 5-6**: Integration phase
   - Merge to unified branch
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Integration testing

6. **Week 7-8**: Optimization and documentation
   - Performance tuning
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Final validation

This branch management plan ensures organized, parallel development while maintaining the ability to integrate features progressively and safely.
