- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity Management**: Modular implementation with clear interfaces
- **Performance Overhead**: Caching strategies and lazy evaluation
- **Integration Challenges**: Well-defined APIs and extensive testing

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Migration Effort**: Backward compatibility and migration tools
- **Learning Curve**: Training materials and intuitive interfaces

## Next Steps

1. **Begin OWL2 Feature Implementation**
   - Start with `owl:hasKey` support in `feature/owl2-enhancements` branch
   - Implement property chain axiom processing
   - Add qualified cardinality restrictions

2. **Begin Generic Traceability Implementation**
   - Refactor `ontologies/core.owl` to generic concepts
   - Create domain extension pattern
   - Implement plugin-based domain management

3. **Prepare Integration**
   - Set up merge strategy for `feature/unified-owl2-generic` branch
   - Create integration testing framework
   - Plan progressive integration approach

This summary provides a clear roadmap for implementing both OWL2 features and generic traceability in parallel branches, with a plan for eventual integration in the unified branch.
