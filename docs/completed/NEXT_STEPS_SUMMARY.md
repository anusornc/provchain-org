**Documentation Tasks**:
- [ ] Update user guides for new features
- [ ] Create developer documentation for OWL2 APIs
- [ ] Add examples and tutorials
- [ ] Update API references

- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Release tagging
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## Timeline Expectations

### Week 1-2: Foundation Implementation
- OWL2: horned-owl enhancements
- Generic: Core ontology refactoring
- Parallel development in feature branches

### Week 3-4: Feature Development
- OWL2: Reasoner implementation and integration
- Generic: Domain plugin architecture and configuration system
- Continuous integration and testing

### Week 5-6: Advanced Features
- OWL2: Complex reasoning and optimization
- Generic: Cross-domain capabilities
- Integration of both feature sets

### Week 7-8: Testing and Refinement
- Comprehensive testing of all features
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- Final validation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Generic traceability system supports any domain
- [ ] OWL2 features (`owl:hasKey`, property chains, qualified cardinality) fully implemented
- [ ] Configuration-driven ontology loading works correctly
- [ ] Domain switching operates seamlessly
- [ ] Cross-domain queries return accurate results

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Property chain inference under 100ms for typical supply chains
- [ ] Uniqueness constraint validation under 50ms
- [ ] Domain switching operations under 1 second
- [ ] Cross-domain queries maintain acceptable performance

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity Management**: Modular implementation with clear interfaces
- **Performance Overhead**: Caching strategies and lazy evaluation
- **Integration Challenges**: Well-defined APIs and extensive testing

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Migration Effort**: Backward compatibility and migration tools
- **Learning Curve**: Training materials and intuitive interfaces

## Conclusion

The ProvChainOrg enhancement project is well-positioned for success with:

1. **Clear Branch Structure**: Organized parallel development approach
2. **Comprehensive Planning**: Detailed roadmaps and implementation plans
3. **Modular Implementation**: Decoupled features that can be developed independently
4. **Progressive Integration**: Ability to merge features incrementally
5. **Thorough Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation at every stage

The team can now begin parallel development on the OWL2 enhancements and generic traceability features, with confidence that the integration path is clear and well-documented.
