# Revised Implementation Plan: Sequential Feature Development

## Workflow Philosophy
Following your preferred approach:
1. **Feature by Feature**: Implement one feature completely before starting the next
2. **Branch by Branch**: Create a branch for each feature, then merge back to main
3. **Continuous Integration**: Keep main branch always working
4. **Simple Management**: Minimal branch overhead

## Implementation Sequence

### Feature 1: OWL2 Enhancements
**Branch**: `feature/owl2-enhancements`
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-4

#### Tasks:
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement `owl:hasKey` axiom support
3. Implement property chain axiom processing
4. Implement qualified cardinality restrictions
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation
7. **Merge back to main** when complete

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All OWL2 features implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Feature 2: Generic Traceability
**Branch**: `feature/generic-traceability`
**Timeline**: Weeks 5-8

#### Tasks:
1. Create feature branch from updated main
2. Refactor core.owl to generic concepts
3. Create domain extension pattern
4. Implement plugin-based domain management
5. Add configuration-driven ontology loading
6. Add comprehensive tests
7. Update documentation
8. **Merge back to main** when complete

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Generic traceability system supports any domain
- [ ] Domain extension pattern works with OWL2 imports
- [ ] Plugin architecture enables dynamic domain loading
- [ ] Configuration-driven system allows flexible deployment
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

### Feature 3: Unified Integration
**Branch**: `feature/unified-integration`
**Timeline**: Weeks 9-10

#### Tasks:
1. Create feature branch from updated main
2. Integrate OWL2 features with generic traceability
3. Implement cross-domain OWL2 reasoning
4. Add comprehensive integration tests
5. Performance optimization
6. Update documentation
7. **Merge back to main** when complete

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Cross-domain OWL2 reasoning works correctly
- [ ] Property chain inference maintains performance
- [ ] Uniqueness constraint validation works across domains
- [ ] All features integrated without breaking changes

## Detailed Workflow

### For Each Feature:

#### Phase 1: Branch Creation
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation
```bash
# Work on feature implementation
# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
git add src/some-modified-file.rs
git commit -m "feat(owl2): Implement owl:hasKey axiom parsing
- Add support for parsing owl:hasKey axioms from ontologies
- Create internal representation for uniqueness constraints
- Add basic validation framework"

# Push to remote for backup
git push origin feature/feature-name
```

#### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
cargo test

# Run feature-specific tests
cargo test feature_name

# Performance testing
cargo test performance
```

#### Phase 4: Documentation
```bash
# Update relevant documentation
# Add new documentation files if needed
# Update README and other relevant docs
```

#### Phase 5: Merge to Main
```bash
# Ensure branch is up to date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/feature-name
git rebase main

# Run final validation
cargo test

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/feature-name

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/feature-name
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### Simplicity
- ✅ Fewer branches to manage
- ✅ Clearer development flow
- ✅ Easier to track progress

### Quality
- ✅ Each feature thoroughly tested before integration
- ✅ Main branch always in working state
- ✅ Clearer accountability for changes

### Risk Management
- ✅ Smaller, more manageable changes
- ✅ Easier to identify and fix issues
- ✅ Reduced merge conflicts

## Implementation Readiness

Both feature branches are already created and ready for development:
- `feature/owl2-enhancements` - Ready for OWL2 implementation
- `feature/generic-traceability` - Ready for generic traceability implementation
- `feature/unified-owl2-generic` - Ready for integration (will rename when needed)

## Next Steps

1. **Start with OWL2 Enhancements**
   - Switch to `feature/owl2-enhancements` branch
   - Begin implementing `owl:hasKey` axiom support
   - Add comprehensive tests for each OWL2 feature

2. **Complete OWL2 Implementation**
   - Implement all OWL2 features (`owl:hasKey`, property chains, qualified cardinality)
   - Ensure performance benchmarks are maintained
   - Update documentation for new features

3. **Merge to Main**
   - Follow the sequential merge process
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update main branch with completed feature

4. **Begin Generic Traceability**
   - Switch to `feature/generic-traceability` branch
   - Refactor core.owl to generic concepts
   - Implement domain extension pattern

This revised plan aligns with your preferred workflow while maintaining the quality and organization of the implementation.
