# Current Implementation Status

## Branch Information
- **Current Branch**: feature/universal-traceability-platform
- **Available Branches**: 
  - main (stable)
  - feature/owl2-enhancements (ready for OWL2 implementation)
  - feature/generic-traceability (ready for generic traceability implementation)
  - feature/unified-owl2-generic (ready for integration)

## Completed Work
1. ✅ Performance optimization (1.20s vs 81s+)
2. ✅ Documentation enhancement
3. ✅ Branch management setup
4. ✅ Basic OWL reasoner framework
5. ✅ All 125 library tests passing

## Next Implementation Steps

### Priority 1: OWL2 Feature Implementation
Branch: `feature/owl2-enhancements`
Tasks:
- [ ] Implement `owl:hasKey` axiom support
- [ ] Add property chain axiom processing
- [ ] Implement qualified cardinality restrictions
- [ ] Integrate with oxigraph for inferred relationships

### Priority 2: Generic Traceability Implementation
Branch: `feature/generic-traceability`
Tasks:
- [ ] Refactor `ontologies/core.owl` to generic concepts
- [ ] Create domain extension pattern
- [ ] Implement plugin-based domain management
- [ ] Add configuration-driven ontology loading

### Priority 3: Unified Integration
Branch: `feature/unified-owl2-generic`
Tasks:
- [ ] Merge OWL2 enhancements with generic traceability
- [ ] Implement cross-domain OWL2 reasoning
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Implementation Approach
1. Work in parallel on feature branches
2. Implement core functionality first
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Integrate in unified branch
5. Optimize performance
6. Update documentation

## For Qwen Code
When implementing features:
1. Focus on one branch at a time
2. Implement core functionality before advanced features
3. Add tests for each implemented feature
4. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
5. Maintain backward compatibility
6. Document new functionality

This status file will be updated as implementation progresses.
