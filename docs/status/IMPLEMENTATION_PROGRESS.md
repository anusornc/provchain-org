- [x] Implement import resolution for ontology dependencies

#### Task 1.2: Generic Entity Model
- [x] Created `TraceableEntity` struct in `src/core/entity.rs`
- [x] Implemented domain-agnostic properties system
- [x] Added support for multiple entity types
- [x] Created entity serialization/deserialization to RDF
- [x] Implemented entity validation interface

#### Task 1.3: OWL Processing Engine
- [x] Integrated OWL reasoner concepts (placeholder implementation)
- [x] Implemented SHACL validation engine concepts (placeholder implementation)
- [x] Created ontology processor abstraction

## Next Steps

### Phase 3 Implementation Focus:
1. Complete SHACL validation shapes for all domains
2. Implement cross-domain relationship mapping
3. Add advanced analytics framework for domain-specific insights
4. Create transaction system updates for universal support
5. Implement API enhancements for domain selection

## Features Demonstrated in Universal Demo

The universal traceability platform demo showcases:

1. **Multi-domain ontology management**: Loading and managing ontologies for different domains
2. **Domain-specific adapters**: Creating adapters for healthcare and pharmaceutical domains
3. **Generic entity model**: Supporting entities across all domains with a single model
4. **Cross-domain validation**: Validating entities against the correct domain adapters
5. **RDF serialization**: Converting entities to RDF for semantic web compatibility
6. **Domain-specific enrichment**: Applying domain-specific processing to entities

This represents a solid foundation for the universal traceability platform with all core infrastructure in place and ready for extension.
