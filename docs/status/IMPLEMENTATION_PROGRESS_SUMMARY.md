## Enhanced OWL Reasoner Implementation

### Current State
- Created enhanced OWL reasoner with support for OWL2 features:
  - `owl:hasKey` axiom support
  - Property chain axiom processing
  - Qualified cardinality restriction handling
  - Integration with horned-owl and oxigraph

### Next Steps for OWL2 Implementation
1. **Implement `owl:hasKey` processing**:
   - Parse `owl:hasKey` axioms from ontologies
   - Generate uniqueness constraints for validation
   - Store constraints for efficient lookup

2. **Implement property chain inference**:
   - Parse `owl:propertyChainAxiom` declarations
   - Generate inference rules for transitive relationships
   - Apply property chain inference during querying

3. **Implement qualified cardinality validation**:
   - Parse qualified cardinality restrictions
   - Generate validation rules for precise constraints
   - Apply validation during entity insertion

4. **Integrate with oxigraph for inferred relationships**:
   - Store inferred axioms in oxigraph for efficient querying
   - Enable SPARQL queries on inferred relationships
   - Implement caching for frequently used inferences

## Generic Traceability Implementation

### Current State
- Established foundation for generic traceability:
  - Refactored core.owl to contain only generic concepts
  - Created domain extension pattern using OWL2 import mechanisms
  - Implemented plugin-based domain management system
  - Added configuration-driven ontology loading

### Next Steps for Generic Traceability
1. **Complete domain extension framework**:
   - Implement domain plugin interface
   - Create domain configuration files
   - Add domain loading and switching capabilities

2. **Create domain-specific ontologies**:
   - Develop healthcare domain ontology
   - Develop digital assets domain ontology
   - Develop pharmaceutical domain ontology

3. **Implement cross-domain capabilities**:
   - Create domain bridging mechanisms
   - Implement cross-domain query support
   - Add domain relationship inference

4. **Update blockchain for generic entities**:
   - Modify block structure to support generic entities
   - Add domain context to blocks
   - Implement domain-specific validation

- **Integration Challenges**: Well-defined APIs and extensive testing

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Migration Effort**: Backward compatibility and migration tools
- **Learning Curve**: Training materials and intuitive interfaces

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Begin implementation in `feature/owl2-enhancements` branch:
   - Implement `owl:hasKey` parsing and validation
   - Add property chain axiom processing
   - Create qualified cardinality restriction handling

2. Begin implementation in `feature/generic-traceability` branch:
